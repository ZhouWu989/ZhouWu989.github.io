**Dec 2022 – Mar 2023**  
**Mentors:** Lin Chao, Zhang Weitai  
- **Core Contribution:** Participated in the first industrialization project of **real-time online translation engine optimization**, covering the full lifecycle from theoretical research to deployment.  
  - Reconstructed the Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model by introducing **sparse attention mechanisms (Local Window Attention)**, reducing computational complexity to \(O(n \log n)\). Inference latency decreased from **120ms to 65ms**, supporting real-time bidirectional translation across **20+ languages**.  
  - **Model lightweighting:** Led the implementation of **mixed-precision training (FP16)** and **dynamic quantization compression**, reducing model size by **40%** and memory usage by **35%** on edge devices.  
  - **Cross-language alignment optimization:** Designed a **cross-lingual contrastive loss function** to address data sparsity in low-resource languages, achieving an **average 4.8% improvement in BLEU scores**.  

**Keywords:** Transformer optimization, multilingual NLP, model lightweighting, industrial deployment.
